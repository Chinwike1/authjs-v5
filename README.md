This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), using the [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/) V5 package.

## Getting Started

First, install the project dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

And configure your environment variables in the following steps:

-   Run `mv .env.example .env.local` in your terminal
-   Then copy-pasta your client ids and secrets!

Next, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

And open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
